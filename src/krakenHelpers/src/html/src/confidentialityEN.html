<h1>Privacy Commitment</h1>
<p>Effective August 22, 2023</p>

<h2>1. Preamble and purpose</h2>
<p>
    Your privacy is important to {{organization.legalName}} and its affiliates
    (“{{organization.name}},” “we,” “us” or “our”). That’s why we are
    implementing reasonable and transparent privacy practices. The purpose of
    this Privacy Commitment (the “Commitment”) is to inform you of these
    practices.
</p>

<p>
    This Commitment describes all of our privacy practices, which are designed
    to protect the Personal Information (“PI”) that we collect and handle in the
    course of our business activities and the maintenance of our business
    relationships, in accordance with applicable laws. It applies to all your
    interactions with {{organization.name}}.
</p>

<h2>2. Definitions</h2>
<p>
    “Data Subject” or “you” means any identified or identifiable individual
    about whom {{organization.name}} collects Personal Information. This
    Commitment does not apply to employees and other members of
    {{organization.name}}’s staff.
</p>

<p>
    “Personal Information” or “PI” means any information about an individual
    that can be used to identify that individual, either directly or indirectly.
</p>

<h2>3. Person in Charge of the Protection of Personal Information</h2>
<p>
    {{organization.name}} has appointed a Person in Charge of the Protection of
    Personal Information (“PCPPI”). This person is responsible for ensuring that
    staff are fully aware of their privacy responsibilities and that business
    practices comply with applicable privacy legislation.
</p>

<p>You can contact our PCPPI at:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Person in Charge of the Protection of Personal Information</li>

    <li>Email: {{organization.email}}</li>

</ul>

<h2>4. Personal Information collected by {{organization.name}}</h2>

<p>
    {{organization.name}} only collects PI that is necessary for its activities.
    This includes information relating to your identity, such as your name,
    address, email address, telephone number, payment information and
    information relating to the use of {{organization.name}}’s web platforms.
</p>

<h2>5. Purposes of collecting Personal Information</h2>
<p>
    We collect PI about you for a variety of purposes that we have previously
    identified, that you have consented to, or that are permitted by law.
</p>

<p>
    In general, and without limitation, we collect PI for the following
    purposes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>1) Provide access to our web and mobile platforms</li>

    <li>
        2) Manage the web platforms, identify trends and draw statistics
        relating to their use, evaluate their performance and improve our
        services
    </li>

    <li>3) Establish and maintain business relationships with our customers</li>

    <li>
        4) Deliver, invoice, collect payment for orders, and follow up on
        orders, requests for quotes and similar requests

    <li>
        5) Get to know our customers better to provide them with relevant
        products and services, in particular through targeted advertising and
        surveys, and optimize our operations
    </li>

    <li>
        6) Provide you with relevant information via our web platforms and
        communications based on your preferences and purchasing and shopping
        habits
    </li>

    <li>7) Enable you to access the financing services of our partners</li>

    <li>
        10) Confirm your identity, verify the accuracy of your PI and update it
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>
    6. Consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal
    Information
</h2>
<p>
    {{organization.name}} collects, uses and discloses your PI on the condition
    that it has obtained your consent in accordance with applicable
    requirements, except in certain specific cases provided by law.
</p>

<p>
    If {{organization.name}} needs to use or disclose your PI for purposes other
    than those that you have consented to, it will again seek your consent,
    except in cases where such consent is not necessary to make other uses or
    where exceptions are provided by law.
</p>

<p>
    You may withdraw your consent to the use and disclosure of your PI for
    purposes that are not essential to the provision of our products and
    services, as set out in Section 12 of this Commitment.
</p>

<h2>7. How we collect your Personal Information</h2>

<h3>a) From you</h3>
Most of the PI we collect is information that you provide directly to us when
you:
<ul>
    <li>Make a purchase online or in store</li>
    <li>Create a customer account online or in store (Customer Login)</li>
    <li>Contact us</li>
    <li>Take part in our surveys</li>
    <li>Subscribe to our communications</li>
    <li>Apply for a job online</li>
</ul>

<h3>b) From third parties</h3>
<p>
    {{organization.name}} may also collect PI about you from third parties, but
    only with your consent or as permitted by law.
</p>

<h3>c) Through our web platforms</h3>
<p>
    {{organization.name}} and its business partners may also collect other
    information related to your use of our web platforms, including your
    customer account, using cookies and web beacons. We use this information to
    learn about how you interact with our web platforms, improve our web
    platforms and product and service offerings, better understand your
    interests, and display advertisements that are relevant to you. Where
    necessary, {{organization.name}} will obtain your consent before collecting
    such information.
</p>

<h2>8. How we limit the disclosure of your Personal Information</h2>
<p>
    {{organization.name}} employees can access PI on a need-to-know basis, i.e.,
    when the PI is necessary for them to perform their duties.
</p>

<p>The PI collected may be disclosed to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Suppliers in the performance of service contracts, such as suppliers of
        advertising, payment and financing services and technological solutions
    </li>

    <li>
        Courts, regulators, government officials or lawyers, and any other party
        charged with investigating or enforcing the law (including to enforce or
        defend our rights and for debt collection purposes)
    </li>
    <li>
        We will ensure that only the necessary PI is disclosed in each case. Any
        disclosure to a supplier will be governed by a contract which provides
        for the implementation of security measures and the destruction of data
        once the service has been provided. We do not sell or rent out your PI.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>9. How we limit the retention of your Personal Information</h2>
<p>
    We will only retain your PI for as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfil
    the purposes for which it was collected, including to comply with legal,
    accounting and disclosure requirements and to enforce or defend our rights.
    For example, when you use our app to find your nearest store, we do not
    retain your store preference; that information is saved in a cookie on your
    device.
</p>

<p>
    Generally, your PI is stored in Canada and our web platforms are hosted in
    Canada. However, business partners with whom we share PI may store it in
    other countries. In such cases, {{organization.name}} will review the
    applicable laws and practices regarding the protection of PI in that country
    and ensure that your PI is adequately protected.
</p>

<h2>10. Commercial electronic communications</h2>
<p>
    We comply with Canada’s anti-spam legislation in our commercial electronic
    communications, including emails, text messages and social media.
</p>

<p>
    If we collect your email address, mobile phone number or social media
    handle, we will use that information in a manner that complies with Canada’s
    anti-spam legislation. For example, we may only send you commercial
    electronic messages if we have your express consent or if we are permitted
    to do so by law. We may send you commercial electronic messages within two
    years of a transaction or within six months of a request for our services.
</p>

<p>
    If you no longer wish to receive commercial electronic messages, you may
    withdraw your consent at any time. However, Canada’s anti-spam legislation
    contains exceptions that allow us to send you certain electronic messages,
    including reminders and messages sent for security purposes or to confirm or
    complete a transaction.
</p>

<h2>11. Security measures</h2>
<p>
    We take the security of our information systems and your PI seriously. The
    security measures that we have in place (including physical, electronic and
    organizational measures) are appropriate to the sensitivity of the PI that
    we hold and are subject to independent audits.
</p>

<p>
    Use of our web platforms involves the exchange of encrypted information,
    primarily when you provide us with payment information or log in to your
    customer account. When you make an online purchase, your credit card
    information may be stored by our payment service provider, which takes the
    security measures required by credit card issuers. {{organization.name}}
    does not retain this information.
</p>

<p>
    We use a number of security measures to adequately protect your PI and
    minimize the risk of a breach. However, there is always a risk, and
    therefore we cannot guarantee 100% that the confidentiality or integrity of
    your PI will not be compromised in the event of a breach of our security
    measures.
</p>

<h2>12. Your rights and how to exercise them</h2>
<p>
    {{organization.name}} respects your legal rights with regard to your PI and
    has set up procedures to deal with the following requests:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        a) Access and rectification: You have the right to access the PI that we
        have collected about you, check its accuracy, make any necessary changes
        and request a copy of it, subject to the exceptions provided by law. You
        can also modify some PI directly in your customer account on our web
        platforms.
    </li>

    <li>
        b) Withdrawal of consent: In certain circumstances, you also have the
        right to withdraw your consent to the use of your PI for purposes that
        are not essential to the provision of our products and services,
        including the provision of targeted advertising and surveys. If you
        choose to withdraw your consent to such use, this will generally result
        in the termination of your contractual relationship with us.
    </li>

    <li>
        c) Portability (effective September 2024): You have the right to request
        that some of your PI be made available to you or another data controller
        in a structured, commonly used and readable format.
    </li>

    <li>
        d) Questions and complaints: You may find that our Privacy Commitment
        does not answer your questions in sufficient detail. If this is the
        case, please contact the PCPPI as soon as possible. The contact details
        of the PCPPI are provided in Section 3. Similarly, any complaint about
        non-compliance with the principles set out in this Commitment should be
        made to the
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Any enquiry relating to this section should be addressed to the PCPPI.
    {{organization.name}} will respond to such requests within 30 days of
    receipt. If {{organization.name}} is unable to meet this deadline or needs
    additional time to respond to a request, it will notify the Data Subject in
    writing.
</p>

<h2>13. Commitment updates</h2>
<h3>a) Applicable version</h3>

<p>
    This Commitment is effective as of the date set forth above and supersedes
    all prior versions. {{organization.name}}’s collection, use, disclosure and
    other handling of a Data Subject’s PI will be governed by the version of the
    Commitment in effect at that time.
</p>

<h3>b) Changes to the Commitment</h3>

<p>
    {{organization.name}} may modify this Commitment from time to time at its
    sole discretion. If the Commitment is amended, you will be notified of the
    changes by a notice posted on the home page of our web platforms and in our
    communication tools for a specified period of time.
